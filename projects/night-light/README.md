## Content 

This project demonstrates the usage of LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor, Photoresistor. In this project, a white LED is connected to the Arduino's digital output pin, and a basic program that get the resistor value of the LDR is used to light on the LED.

## How it works
1. **Circuit Setup**: the LED and the LDR are connected to a digital pin on the Arduino through a resistor to limit the current. 
2. **Programming**: The Arduino is programmed to turn the LED on when the detected value of the LDR is less than 500. It turns off otherwise.
